# Bring Twitter Back
A browser extension for Firefox that turns X back into Twitter.

I've spent way more time on this than I thought I would.

# Installation
## Firefox
Install it from the [Firefox Add-ons website](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bring-the-twitter-bird-back")

Alternatively, you can download the .xpi file [here](https://github.com/SauceyRed/bring-twitter-back/releases/latest) under "Downloads" (which will only download the file without automatically installing it) or under "Assets" (which will automatically install it).

## Chromium (Chrome, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, Edge, DuckDuckGo, etc.)
Install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bring-twitter-back/jecdadfjcmplcnmnglbhcjbfigbohcef)!

Alternatively, you can download the .crx file [here](https://github.com/SauceyRed/bring-twitter-back/releases/latest) under "Assets".
